# PokemonGO-Vault
First website (now abandoned); utilizes AngularJS and Bootstrap frameworks. Uses AngularJS ng-repeat to loop through a JSON file to populate the Pokemon data.

Note: Currently Abandoned.

Notable features & achievements:
  1. First full implementation of AngularJS and Bootstrap 3,
  2. Usage of ngRepeat directives and filters to present a list of all (or some) Pokemon to the user,
  3. Modal on each Pokemon to provide more detail and also a nested ngRepeat directive,
  4. JSON file to store all data and serve it up to Angular (ideally a Node.js backend would have been more appropriate), and
  5. Custom JS to calculate various things.
